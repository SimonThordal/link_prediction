This behaviour is not shown in the histogram which seems closer to the exponential distribution of interarrival times in a Poisson process.

This can lead to hard to interpret or misleading results of the classification methods (Link prediction, fair evaluation) especially when using the traditional area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) metric for evaluating links. A better alternative is to use precision recall curve (PRC) which is proven to give equivalent results to ROC (The relationship between precision-recall and ROC).\n",

    "Another issue is that the number of potential edges is $V^2$ where $V$ is the number of vertices in the network and the ratio of existing edges to non-existing edges, $\\frac{E}{V^2-E}$, is usually very small, resulting in very high computation times. Undersampling the non-existing edges leads to erroneous precision results, so instead the existing edges are undersampled and scores are only calculated for non-existing edges that will give a score higher than 0. This results in lower computation time without distorting the methods precision while still following the guidelines set out by Lichtenwalter and Chawla (Link prediction, fair evaluation) for evaluation of link prediction methods.\n",

    "For the network of verdicts a reasonable application is a recommender system so an evaluation method that mimics this use-case is preferable. We choose a node centric approach where nodes of a specific degree, $k$, are chosen to create a test set, $V_{test}$ and for each node in the test set we remove all but one edge from the node and attempt to predict the remaining $k-1$ nodes.
