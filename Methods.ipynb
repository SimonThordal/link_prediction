    "## Link prediction\n",
    "Link prediction can refer to either inferring links that are likely to appear in a dynamic network or missing links in a static network <a name=\"ref-1\"/>[(Lü and Zhou, 2011)](#cite-Lu20111150). In a network of nodes and links $G(V,E)$ a prediction can return a ranking of all possible non-existing links $U-E$ where $U$ is the universal set consisting of all posible links between \n",
    "nodes. The ranking itself is found by sorting the potential links by some method dependent score.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare the  methods the benchmarks used are area under the ROC curve and precision along with a training and validation set, $U^T$ and $U^P$. It is standard to run the algorithms on the full set of $U-E^T$ <a name=\"ref-2\"/>[(Lü and Zhou, 2011)](#cite-Lu20111150), but for computation time reasons it might be possible to only select a subset of $U-E$ as non-existent links. The area under the ROC (AUC) is found by comparing the scores of every non-existent link with the score of a removed link. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n'$ is the number of trials where the removed link had a higher score than the non-existent one and the $n''$ is the number of times the score of the non-existent link was greater or equal to the score of the removed link. $n$ is the total number of trials.\n",

Another alternative way is to calculate the similarity based solely on the relevance information, namely whether a user has voted an object. The former one uses more information than the latter, and is intuitively expected to give more accurate rating predictions under the standard collaborative filtering framework. However, according to the extensive experimental analysis, this letter reports the opposite results that the latter method, making use of only the relevance information, can outperform the former method, especially when the data set is sparse. Our finding challenges the routine knowledge on information filtering, and suggests some alternatives to address the sparsity problem.}\n",
